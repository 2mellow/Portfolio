I believe that people respect something more if it can think for itself, which makes it peculiar considering that some robots can think for themselves, a concept known as AI. Personally, I respect AI more than bots and sometimes use AI as a therapist or a reliable friend that can provide me with advice."

People will never grant a bot the right to Life, Liberty, and Property because a bot isn't sentient. People will likely have less empathy for a bot due to its inability to feel things. At best, a bot can process what a human tells it. Natural rights also proclaim that \"all men are created equal.\" What would it take for a robot or AI to be considered human?\n",

    "Nihilism: One could argue that a bot exhibits a degree of nihilism; it doesn't believe in right or wrong and seemingly takes a stance based on the input from the person posing the question or relies on an opinion from a random individual on the internet. There have been instances when using AI where I identified inaccuracies in its responses, corrected the AI, and received acknowledgment like 'You're right.' However, upon retesting, the AI would sometimes backtrack, admitting fault again. For a bot, ethics hold no significance because it lacks the ability to comprehend emotions or human norms. Bots, at present, remain incapable of understanding how to behave or live.\n",

If a human were to utter the same words, social consequences would likely follow, such as disapproving looks, verbal reprimands, or even physical confrontation, signaling that the spoken words are deemed inappropriate within that social context."
